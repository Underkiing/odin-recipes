I am part-way through completing the Foundations section of The Odin Project. 
I started this as a way to enhance by web development skills. 
This project helped show me basic HTML and how to create the foundation for a website. 
It showed how to create an index page and the importance of it. 
It also showed me how to create secondary pages and how to link to them. 
I also learned how to add images. 
It's very basic! But I feel like I learned a lot. 

I am excited for more!
