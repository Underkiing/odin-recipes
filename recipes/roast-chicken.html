    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Whole Chicken</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp of Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon, quartered</li>
        <li>3 rosemary sprigs</li>
        <h4>Butter</h4>
        <li>100g / 1 stick of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of sage</li>
        <li>2 tsp of rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220C/450F (standard) or 200C/430F (fan/convection). Put shelf in the middle.</li>
        <li>Mix together Butter ingredients. Add juice from 2 wedges of lemon.</li>
        <li> Place chicken in a roasting pan. Use a dessert spoon to loosen skin from chicken (see video). Do the top (the breast) and the drumsticks â€“ not the underside.</li>
        <li> Prop chicken upright, drizzle butter under skin, using most of the garlic/herb sludge, but saving a bit of butter for the skin (Note 3).</li>
        <li>Drizzle / smear remaining butter all over surface of the chicken. Squeeze over juice of 2 lemon wedges.</li>
        <li> Stuff used lemon wedges and rosemary inside chicken.</li>
        <li> Tie drumstick ends with string and tuck wing tips under the chicken.Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li> Place onion and garlic in the pan, place chicken on top. Pour wine around, drizzle chicken with oil.</li>
        <li> Transfer to oven. Roast for 10 minutes, then turn oven down to 180C/350F (all oven types). Roast for a further 1 hr 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature is 75C/165F or until juices run clear when pierced at the join between the drumstick and the body.</li> 
        <li> Baste twice (30 min then at 1 hr), spooning pan juices over skin.</li>
        <li> Rest for 15 minutes - don't cover, skin becomes wet.</li>
        <li> Serve with pan juices (see video for how to carve). I discard onion but use the garlic in the pan. See notes for side suggestions & how to use carcass for incredible homemade broth!</li>
